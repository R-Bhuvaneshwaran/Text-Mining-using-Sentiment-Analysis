# Text Mining using Sentiment Analysis

# Abstract
Customers can learn more about a product's quality through its reviews. Product rankings will change as a result of taking into account a variety of product review characteristics, such as product quality, content, duration of the review relative to the product's longevity, and historically older good customer evaluations. On the other hand, a manual method on a wide scale is time-consuming, which results in an ineffective and unproductive way. Machine learning has been the most practical method for training the system in current era of artificial intelligence. Therefore, if a model were established to polarise those evaluations and learn from them, it would be lot simpler go through numerous comments.

# Introduction

Hence, this projects presents a novel Genetic Optimized Multi-Class Hierarchy Binary-weighted Multinomial Naive Bayesian (GO-MHBNB) approach to classify the customer reviews. We collected the Amazon consumer reviews dataset for this research. To extract meaningful information like positivity or negativity from the raw data samples, stop word removal, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization methods are used.This experiment is performed by employing the Python tool. Furthermore, the proposed approach is also compared with existing methods like support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) in this research. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach produces good performance over the existing methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score regarding the classification of the customer reviews in positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
